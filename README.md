# PFE2
Welcome to the People-of-the-Founding-Era GitHub site.
The biographical information that appears in People of the Founding Era is taken from the annotations and editorial apparatus created by the editors of the Founding Fathers and other authoritative editions. Information from numerous editions has been gathered and the biographical information aggregated into a biographical glossary of the Founding era.

The creation of People of the Founding Era was made possible by the digitization of the editions of the Founding Fathers by the University of Virginia's digital imprint, Rotunda. Beginning with the Papers of George Washington in 2007, Rotunda has made available online over 250 volumes of Founding Fathers content. By aggregating from this digital resource all of the biographical content for a given person and presenting it to the user as a single and unique "record," PFE isolates relevant, informative text from references to people of the same name and simply passing mentions.

The project was supported by multiple grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation beginning in 2008 and concluding in 2016. What is included here is code related to processing of names and other datasets from partners on the project as well as project guidelines.
