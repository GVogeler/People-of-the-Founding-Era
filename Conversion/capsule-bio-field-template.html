        <p>William Wilberforce, Great Britain&rsquo;s leading antislavery advocate, had written urging that the United States agree with Britain mutually to enforce each other&rsquo;s bans on the transatlantic slave trade. He expressed concern that in the case of the seizure by the British navy of slave ships sailing under the American flag, legal opinions had been obtained suggesting that the slaves might have to be returned to their American owners (Wilberforce to TJ, Sept. 1808 [NN]). Rodney ventured his opinion of Wilberforce&rsquo;s letter on 28 Feb. 1809 (DLC), arguing that while a British court could not apply American criminal law to the slave traders, it could and should deny claimants the restoration of property forfeited under the American law abolishing the slave trade. On 28 July 1810 the British lords commissioners of appeals in prize causes  let stand a vice-admiralty decision confiscating and freeing a cargo of slaves from the American vessel Amedie and awarding the ship to its captors, because carrying such a cargo violated both British and American bans on international slave trading (Thomas Harman Acton, Reports of Cases Argued and Determined Before the Most Noble and Right Honourable The Lords Commissioners of Appeals in Prize Causes: Also on Appeal to the King&rsquo;s Most Excellent Majesty in Council [London, 1811], 1:240&ndash;51).</p>
